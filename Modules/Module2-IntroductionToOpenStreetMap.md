**Learning Objectives:**

1. Given the **[History of OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/History_of_OpenStreetMap)** and **[Moments in the History of OpenStreetMap](https://www.flickr.com/photos/omnitarian/8466817332/sizes/o/in/photostream/)**, students will be able to describe the history of the OSM.  Students will understand most important historical facts about the OSM project found at these resources including:

    * The name of the founder, location and founding year

    * The establishment year of the OSM Foundation and its role in the project

    * Identification of the three main editors and the historical dates of their releases and development

    * The first dates of two companies providing aerial photography/imagery for OSM software

    * The start of United States Census Bureau’s TIGER data importing, a massive advancement in the amount and quality of United States OSM data

    * The name, year and location of the 1st OSM conference

    * The name of the current default editor

    * The year that the Open Database License was applied and what it achieves

2. Using **[About OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap)**, **[OSM Press Kit](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Press_Kit#Brief_facts)** and **[OpenStreetMap Country Stats](http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2016/06/02/countrystats/)**, students will gain an understanding of what the OSM project is and learn how communities have historically contributed data along with the amount of data contributed over time.  Students will be able to articulate what the OSM project is and provide examples to different ways people can contribute.

3. Reading the **[Why don’t you just use Google Maps/whoever for your data?](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/FAQ#Why_don.27t_you_just_use_Google_Maps.2Fwhoever_for_your_data.3F)**, students will develop the ability to explain why OSM’s open-source software is important.

* Gain an understanding of the history/stats/facts of OSM from beginning to present day.

* Gain an understanding of the importance of OSM with connections to map applications from social good to industry and in between.

* Make a connection to local map features found in the school’s community.

* Start to visualize how, the pace and where the map is edited.

* Research an OSM article and articulate the student’s reason for choosing the article.

## **Preparation**

1. Read the **[History of OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/History_of_OpenStreetMap)** and **[Moments in the History of OpenStreetMap](https://www.flickr.com/photos/omnitarian/8466817332/sizes/o/in/photostream/)** and get acquainted with some of the more important milestones in the project’s history.  Specifically, prepare answers to the following:

    * The name of the founder, location and founding year

    * The establishment year of the OSM Foundation and its role in the project

    * Identification of the three main editors and the historical dates of their releases and development

    * The first dates of two companies providing aerial photography/imagery for OSM software

    * The start of United States Census Bureau’s TIGER data importing, a massive advancement in the amount and quality of United States OSM data

    * The name, year and location of the 1st OSM conference

2. Review **[About OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap)**, **[OSM Press Kit](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Press_Kit#Brief_facts)** and **[OpenStreetMap Country Stats](http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2016/06/02/countrystats/)** and develop an understanding of what the OSM project is and how communities have historically contributed data.  With respect to the amount of data contributed over time, what causes the increase in named road length data by 10x between 2008 and 2009?

3. Read **[Why don’t you just use Google Maps/whoever for your data?](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/FAQ#Why_don.27t_you_just_use_Google_Maps.2Fwhoever_for_your_data.3F)** and understand that the difference between OSM data and Google/Bing/Here, etc. map data is the copyright protection.

## **In Class Educator Lecture**

1.  Have students break into groups and answer these eight questions.  Students  must use the **[History of OpenStreetMap](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/History_of_OpenStreetMap)** and **[Moments in the History of OpenStreetMap](https://www.flickr.com/photos/omnitarian/8466817332/sizes/o/in/photostream/)** resources to answer.  Have the groups share their findings with the class, along with the source of their answers with the rest of the class.

    1. The name of the founder, location and founding year

    2. The establishment year of the OSM Foundation and its role in the project

    3. Identification of the three main editors and the historical dates of their releases and development

    4. The first dates of two companies providing aerial photography/imagery for OSM software

    5. The start of United States Census Bureau’s TIGER data importing, a massive advancement in the amount and quality of United States OSM data

    6. The name, year and location of the 1st OSM conference

    7. The name of the current default editor

    8. The year that the Open Database License was applied and what it achieves

2. Have students navigate to, and read, **[About OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap)**, **[OSM Press Kit](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Press_Kit#Brief_facts)** and **[OpenStreetMap Country Stats](http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2016/06/02/countrystats/)**.  After reading has completed:

    9. Call on students to individually explain what OSM is in their own words and share 2 facts that they had not known about the OSM project prior to reading these resources.

    10. Show students **[OpenStreetMap Country Stats](http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2016/06/02/countrystats/)** and ask them why there is a spike in road data in the U.S. circa 2008.  By clicking on the most recent year column in the table, sort descending and look at the disparity between the amount of United States Road data and all other nations.

3. Finish with a live **[visualizations of edits](http://live.openstreetmap.fr/)** happening all over the world.  Among other things, pay attention and discuss with students

    11. when possible, make a list of running locations edited

    12. If possible, discuss the local time where edits happen

    13. whenever possible, make local and curriculum connections.

4. **_If time permits_**, split the class into groups (a list below provides examples of topics for each group) and have the students look around for articles containing ‘OpenStreetMap’ and the corresponding group topic.  Share their findings with the class.  This will prepare them for their assignment.

    14. Business

    15. Humanitarian work

    16. City planning

    17. Government

    18. Water supply

    19. Poverty

## **Student Assignment**

Students must create a 1 page paper describing an OSM article over the past year and the reason the student chose it.

Examples of OSM articles and their associated topics include:

* [Stress levels biking through a city using OSM data (Next City)](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/bike-survey-stress-mapping)

* [OSM assisting with the restoration of abandoned mines (US DOI)](https://www.doi.gov/blog/abandonedmines)

* [OSM data & art to best understand our cities (Forbes)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lauriewinkless/2017/02/07/understanding-our-cities-thanks-to-beautiful-maps/#4974a93b1c69)

* [The Missing Maps project making significant strides in 2015 (opensource.com)](https://opensource.com/life/15/12/creating-worlds-missing-maps-openstreetmap)

* [JP Morgan Chase employees contribute to the Missing Maps project (JP)](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/corporate/news/stories/why-are-we-mapping-missing-maps.htm)

**NOTE:**  This work will then be entered into each student’s journal upon being created in the next module.
