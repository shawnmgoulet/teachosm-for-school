### **Educator Classroom Discussion**

The teacher can discuss the topic of culture – learned behavior.

**Sample Starter Questions**

1. What types of religious institutions are found locally?

2. What sports/extracurricular activities are popular?  What types of recreational facilities are there?

3. What types of restaurants are popular?  What are the nationalities represented by cuisines offered by restaurants?

4. What are the nationality/social clubs?  Where are they and are they located in an area of town dominated by the particular nationality?

**Student Assignment**

1. Students can be put into groups and given one cultural component?  Religion, Sports Facilities, Restaurants.

2. Students should then begin to mentally map on a piece of paper the location of their cultural facilities.

3. Then each group can present their findings

4. Then have the students use Overpass Turbo to examine their findings: [http:/](http://overpass-turbo.eu/)[/overpass-turbo.eu/](http://overpass-turbo.eu/) Run Overpass API queries and analyze the resulting OpenStreetMap data interactively on a map.

    1. Navigate to the area your are working. Use the search box or just pan manually.

    2. Click the Wizard button

    3. Use the following syntax to search for your OSM edits:user: your_osm_name eg. user:SEJohnson

    4. Your stats show up in the bottom right corner of screen

5. Which buildings and institutions are missing?

6. Students then can go into OpenStreetMap and add the missing buildings or institutions.

7. Students should use the OpenStreetMap Wiki to understand the tagging system.  Here is the Religion Category: [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:religion](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:religion)
