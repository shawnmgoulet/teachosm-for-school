## **Educator Preparation**

Toolset: The TeachOSM Tasking Manager

Time required: ~30 minutes

1. The purpose of the Tasking Manager is to:

    1. Bring order to the map creation process

    2. Prevent database collisions

    3. Prevent duplicate coverage

    4. Facilitate workflow

    5. Break a project into manageable size

2. Point your browser to the TeachOSM Tasking Manager: [http://tasks.teachosm.org](http://tasks.teachosm.org)

3. In the upper right hand corner, click on ‘login to OpenStreetMap’.

4. Enter your login information to sign in.

5. From the drop-down list, select, ‘Create a new project’

![TeachOSM Tasking Manager | Dropdown](https://github.com/shawnmgoulet/teachosm-for-school/blob/master/Images/tasking-manager-dropdown.pngg)

6. Using the ‘+/-’ buttons or the mouse wheel, zoom in to the area of interest, then draw an outline of the area.

7. After you’ve drawn the outline, select ‘Square Grid’ to split the area of interest into squares of equal size.

8. Size the grid cells appropriately. Bear in mind that dense squares can be split, but small squares cannot be recombined so it is better to keep them large and split individual cells according to need.

9. Draft concise, but comprehensive instructions to mappers.  The instructions are written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.

**NOTE:**  The Markdown syntax allows for styling of the instructions (e.g. title, subtitle, bold, italicize, etc.).  Markdown is a straightforward syntax to learn.  A great resource for Markdown is [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

10. Once you have completed instructions, click ‘Publish’ to make your project visible to students and any other mappers.

## Managing Your Tasks

There will come a time when you want to close, remove, or delete a task from the TeachOSM Tasking Manager. There are many motivations for this, such as to impose a project-driven deadline, the project is old and stale, or when all features have been mapped and the task has been completed. (Hooray!) This is accomplished by ‘archiving’ the task, which removes it from public view.

To archive a task, do the following:

1. Log in to the TeachOSM Tasking Manager

2. In the search box, enter a keyword (e.g. ‘Uganda’) or task number (e.g. 388) to find the task you want to close. Select the task.

3. From the task page, click on ‘Edit’ to edit the task properties.

4. Locate the ‘Status’ and from the dropdown list select, ‘Archived’ as shown in the image below.

Once the task is archived, it will no longer show up in the default view of active tasks.

## **Educator Lecture**

Toolset: TeachOSM Tasking Manager

Time Required: ~20 minutes

1.  Give the class a walk-through of the TeachOSM Tasking Manager:

    1. Show how tasks are created

    2. Emphasize the instructions and the importance of following them

    3. Define what is meant by ‘complete’ and the conditions under which squares are marked ‘complete’

    4. Show how to select a task and begin mapping

    5. Show how to unlock an incomplete square for later mapping

    6. Show how to mark a task square complete

* * *


## **Student Assignment**

Toolset: TeachOSM and HOTOSM Tasking Managers

Time Required: ~20 minutes

1. Students will access both the TeachOSM and HOT Tasking Managers.

2. Using the search box, students will search for mapping tasks:

    1. For newbies

    2. Buildings Only

    3. Roads Only

    4. Urgent tasks

    5. Special Tasks

3. Students will choose a task to contribute to, read the mapping instructions, and complete one square. Students will document their choice of task square (copying the URL from the address bar) and paste it in their journal and summarize the work completed.

4. Students will either mark the square as complete (if and only if complete!) OR they will unlock the square to continue mapping later.
