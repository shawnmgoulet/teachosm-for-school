# **Module 3 | OSM Contributing Onboarding**

## **Overview**

**Module Title:** Module 3 | OSM Contributing Onboarding

**Activity Title:**  This module organizes basic OSM contributing resources for teachers to introduce to students to initialize the concept of students making contributions to the OSM project.

In this module, students will be fully prepared to contribute to the OSM project.  Students will familiarize themselves with these mapping-ready resources and answer open-ended questions on important points of the three resources.

The three resources students will learn about include:

1. map features: the physical on the ground features that collectively comprise the map.  Below is a screenshot of the ‘library’ map feature as of July 5, 2017.

2. good practices: guidelines that increase the quality and value of OSM data

3. getting started: learn step by step how to navigate the OSM site, view maps, and sign up for a user account

**Learning Objectives:**

1. Given the **[OSM Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features)**, students will be able to identify and provide examples of the "on the ground features" that collectively comprise the OSM.  Students will explore and generate a list of features that are found in the neighborhood(s) in which they live and spend the majority of their time.  Students will draw a mental map of the neighborhoods with these features.  Two possible features include:

    1. **[fire hydrants](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:emergency%3Dfire_hydrant**) (a.k.a. fire plugs and johnny pumps)

    2. **[stop signs](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dstop)** (a.k.a. stop lines and four-way stops)

2. In respect to the **[OSM Good Practices](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice)**, students will develop the ability to articulate guidelines surrounding contributing to the OSM and understand why they are important.

3. Using **[learnOSM | Getting Started](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/start-osm/)**, students will become fully prepared to contribute to OSM, creating an OSM account and beginning to explore the "edit" mode using the iD Editor.

* Internet Connection

## **Educator Preparation**

1. Explore the **[OSM Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features)**.

* Run a search on the Map Features page.

    * On a Windows machine, press (and hold) the ‘Control‘ key + click the ‘F’ key.

    * On an Apple machine, press (and hold) the ‘Command‘ key + click the ‘F’ key on)

    * For example, consider searching for transportation-related keywords including:

        * "transportation", “public transport”, “ferry” and “railway”

    * Consider searching for additional features found in your area and compile an introductory list of ~20 to present to students.

        * for example, local **[non-governmental organization](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:office=ngo?uselang=en)** offices such as the Red Cross and **[elementary, middle and high schools](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Dschool)**

2. Read through **[OSM Good Practices](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice)**.

* Run a search on the Map Features page.

* Make a bulleted list of good and bad mapping practices.

* Review the **[Good Changeset Comments](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments)** page.  Understand that a changeset is OSM’s equivalent to a document "save as" or a git version control “commit”.

* Students will start off editing using the **[iD or iD Editor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID)** OSM editor.  Pay attention to documentation related to this editor opposed to others including JOSM and Potlatch.

* Constant review and student critique relative to these mapping habits is important.  As such, this resource should be referred to regularly throughout the course of students contributing to the project.

3. Navigate to **[learnOSM Getting Started](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/start-osm/)** and learn about navigating the map, viewing different map styles, creating an OSM account and adding a first point.

* Recall that students will only be using iD or iD Editor to make edits.  Pay attention to iD or iD Editor documentation on the learnOSM Site.

* * *


## **In Class Educator Lecture**

1. Show students the **[OSM Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features)** page.

* Explain to students that features are physical features on the ground that are fixated in their spatial position.

* Talk about those that are not features on the map, like automobiles.

* Ask students for features they would expect to find on the page based on content covered in the course.  Compile a list of these and discuss each either locally or in some place studied thus far in the course.

* Show students the search method described in "Educator Preparation" to search the page for features.  Click on a couple different features and read their definitions.  For instance, some more granular features such as “high school” are specified in the attributes for the school feature.

* Split the class into groups and have each group look for features they would expect to find associated with the sections of the course covered thus far.  Upon completion, have students present the lists to the class.

2. Introduce students to the **[OSM Good Practices](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice)** page.

* Review all good practice points.

* Hold a class discussion centered around a few of these points.  For example:

    * Correcting errors: it is as important to maintain the attribute data of the features as it is to maintain the correct geospatial location of the feature.

* Drive home the message, that the reason for having these suggested practices is to create a healthy contribution environment that is structured.  In turn, this forms the foundation of the proper way to contribute to the project.

3. Path students to the **[learnOSM Getting Started](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/start-osm/)** page.

* Provide students with an introduction to the page.

* Inform students that they will be using iD/iD Editor for editing the OSM.

* Identify the the portion discussing account registration.

## **Student Assignment**

_Students should have already made their first entry into their journal._

_Students must continue to contribute to their student journal to describe with text and screenshots their contributions, issues, questions, etc. when making contributions to the OSM._

_Teachers will create a folder for journals and ask students to save their journals to the folder (e.g. Google Drive folder or some other place where all students and teachers access and save to)._

**_The following should be entered into your journal._**

1. List and give specific examples of at least 20 map features in your neighborhood or the neighborhoods you frequent most.  Do these features tell us anything about our community?  Are these features found in other countries in North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Africa, Australia or Antarctica or are they only found in North America or your area?

2. Why are good practices important?  Read **[Editing Standards and Conventions](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editing_Standards_and_Conventions)**.  When editing, how accurate is "accurate enough"?  Discuss why you think OSM is so successful when the data that comprises the map is editable by anyone when anyone could update the features with inaccurate data?

3. For good practices, do you see anything missing?  Do you see any conflict between them?  If you had to pick the top three good practices to keep in mind at all times when contributing to OSM, which would they be?

4. Read, in its entirety, the **[LearnOSM Getting Started](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/start-osm/) page**.

5. Register for an OSM account, sign into OSM clicking on the iD editor to edit to explore the map in edit mode.  Do not make any edits, only explore the software.  What is confusing, what do you like and what are you still unclear about?  Enter these answers, along with anything else into your journal.
