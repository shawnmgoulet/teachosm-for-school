## **Educator Preparation**

What should the facilitator do **before** teaching this lesson?

* Facilitators should have created an OpenStreetMap account in Module 3 before undertaking this Module.

* Facilitators should spend as much time with the iD Editor ‘Walkthrough’ as possible. The Walk Through is self-directed and interactive introduction to ALL of the functionality contained in the iD Editor.

* * *


### **Introduction**

By now you have your OpenStreetMap account, you’re familiar with the OpenStreetMap interface, you’ve located an area of interest, and you’re ready to map. In this module, we take control of the **iD Editor** and learn to add our own geographic data to the map. At the end of this module, you will be able to add simple features to OpenStreetMap, give those features descriptive ‘tags’, navigate the iD interface to personalize your controls, and understand how to use iD’s Help facility.

## **Student Activity**

1. Log in to OpenStreetMap

2. Navigate to an area that is familiar to you. Use the ‘Search’ box and type in a place name.

3. Zoom in closely, to an area equivalent to a few city blocks or so.

4. Click on the Edit button on the top left hand corner of the OSM map window, and choose ‘iD Editor’ as seen in the example below:

5. Go through the iD Walkthrough tutorial. The walkthrough is a brief but comprehensive utility to help you navigate the iD editor, understand how to add points, lines, and polygons, and how to add buildings. None of the data created in the Walkthrough is saved, so you are free to make mistakes and practice here. However, **once you start editing you will need to exercise more caution!**

6. After finishing Walkthrough, navigate to your neighborhood or a place *very* familiar to you.

### **Drawing Shapes (Polygons)**

7. Let’s start by adding some buildings. Most times, we map building as polygons, or ‘areas’ in they’re called in OSM. A "polygon" in the iD editor is actually a “closed way” with tags on it. To add a new building, click on the **Area** button.

* Your mouse cursor will change into plus (+) sign. Try to trace a building using 	the imagery as a guide. Click on all four (or more) corners of the building. Double-click on the last point to finish.

* In the left hand pane, search for **‘Building’**.  For now, just tag it as a generic building. You will notice that the color of your shape will change once you’ve tagged it.

* Square your building by typing ‘s’ or by right-clicking on the line and select the **square** option from the context menu as shown below.

### **Drawing Roads (and other lines)**

8. Drawing roads. Parking lots aisles and driveways are an easy start. Make sure all road segments connect as shown in the image below.

Once you’ve mastered the connectivity and road tagging, graduate to bigger roads. Make sure the road is named. Classify roads as **‘residential’** unless you know otherwise.

### **Adding Points-of-Interest (and other point features)**

9. Now let’s add a local business or an institution or another POIs as a point feature. Click the **‘Point’** button. Your mouse cursor will change into plus (+) sign. Now, click on a position that you know to mark a location. For example, if you know that there is a hospital in your area, click on the position of the hospital building as shown in the image below:

![OpenStreetMap | iD Editor | Point Map Feature](https://github.com/shawnmgoulet/teachosm-for-high-school/blob/master/Images/openstreetmap-id-editor-point-map-feature.png)

Notice that a new point is added. At the same time, the left panel will change to show a form where you can select attributes for the object. Click **Hospital Grounds** to tag the point as a hospital as shown in the image below.

* You can use the forms to fill detailed information about your point. You can fill hospital name, address, and/or other additional information. Note that each feature will have different options, depending on what tag you choose from the feature panel. Make sure they’re properly tagged: name, address, phone, website, Wikipedia, opening hours, etc.

* If you make a mistake, such as a wrong location, you can **move** your point to a new 	location by holding the left mouse button on your point and dragging it. Or, if you want to **delete** your point, click the left mouse button on the point and then click the button which looks like a trashcan.

* A "point" created in the iD Editor is actually a standalone “node” with a set of “tags” on it.

### Additional Information and Custom Tags

When you are editing an object, you will see a strip of icons at the bottom of the attribute panel. You can add additional information by clicking the appropriate icons:

* Add elevation

* Add notes

* Add contacts / phone number

* Add source tag 	

* Add website

* Add accessibility information

* Add Wikipedia link

### Saving Your Work

To save your changes, click the **‘Save’** button. This brings up the panel shown in the image below. *Don’t neglect the ‘changeset comment’!* Add a brief description of what you’ve edited, along with a source that confirms you know about what you are mapping. Local knowledge, for instance, is a source.  The changeset comment helps you track the work for quality as well as credit and recognition.
