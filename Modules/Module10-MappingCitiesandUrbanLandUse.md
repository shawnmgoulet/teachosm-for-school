## **Educator Preparation**

1. Figure-ground maps are used by urban planners as a way of showing the relationship between built and unbuilt space. The figure-ground map provides a two-dimensional view of the city that emphasizes the spaces in between the built environment. This is useful for comparing the built form of urban areas. Review the blog post on OpenStreetMap using the Geoff Boeing OSMnx tool: [http://geoffboeing.com/2017/04/urban-form-analysis-openstreetmap/](http://geoffboeing.com/2017/04/urban-form-analysis-openstreetmap/)

## **In Class Educator Lecture**

1. **Demonstrate how to search by placename** - Navigate to [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/).

  NOTE:  [Nominatim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazetteer) is a ‘gazetteer’, an index of place names linked to geographic coordinates. Demonstrate the use of Nominatim by searching for an ancient city selected from the list found at the [Historic Cities](http://historic-cities.huji.ac.il/search_a_z.html) page. (Hint: Palmanova, Italy makes for a good example.) Note the shape of the city and arrangement of urban features against the transportation network. Make sure to demonstrate a range of places to show students how Nominatim returns data about a place and what to look for in the page.  Also, show students the map features associated with the place and compare densities between urban centers and outlying areas.

2. **Create your own figure ground maps** - Next, browse to [FieldPapers](http://fieldpapers.org) and click on ‘Make yourself an atlas’. ClickDemonstrate how to navigate to an urban area and use Overpass Turbo to retrieve features in the city. For example, create and run a query for ‘cafe’.  Have a discussion with students to generate a list of these map features from memory.  Introduce resources such as the municipality web site, state/County web sites, local business directories and chamber of commerces.  Discuss with students what is already mapped and if it is mapped correctly and, also, what is missing from the map.

#### **Student Assignment**

*If not already done, students must complete the [learnOSM | Getting Started](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/start-osm/) exercises and make their first contributions to the OSM within the High School's municipality prior to starting this exercise.*

*With the above, students should have already made their first entry into their journal.*

*Students must continue to contribute to their student journal to describe with text and screen shots their contributions, issues, questions, etc. when making contributions to the OSM.*

*Teachers will create a folder for journals and ask students to save their journals to the folder (e.g. Google Drive folder or some other place where all students and teachers access and save to).*

1. First, have students look at examples of historic urban form:

2. Next, review Christopher Alexander’s 'How to Make a Downtown' on the ingredients for successful urban placemaking: [http://www.patternlanguage.com/sequences/slideshows/multipage/downtown-slides.html](http://www.patternlanguage.com/sequences/slideshows/multipage/downtown-slides.html)

3. Read the Fused Grid article on the history and evolution of urban form: [http://www.fusedgrid.ca/](http://www.fusedgrid.ca/)

4. Now we’ll investigate the urban structure of your town.

1. Using [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/), search for your town and navigate.  Compare the two locations looking at the organization of space, and map feature types. If buildings are missing, identify where they should be.

    1. Wherever possible, add/update these features using iD Editor.

2. Examine the arrangement of public facilities, locally, followed by the other chosen municipality. For this step, use [overpass turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) by executing queries such as the query for ‘office=government‘ or ‘building=office‘ and other map features you have identified.  Other features include police and fire facilities, town/city hall, courthouses and city/county infrastructure.

3. Where are the major public spaces in your town? Look for parks, playgrounds, public squares and event spaces. Are they mapped?

4. Describe the street network. Is it laid out on a grid? Or, are streets arranged in spokes? Or rings? Is there a central square or open space? Compare two cities and their street networks. Why might they differ? How does the transportation network effect the urban form?

5. Along the way, identify any and all missing governmental/political map features.  At the end, log into [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) and map missing buildings and other pertinent infrastructure, along with adding attribute information.

6. Discuss similarities and differences in the arrangement of streets and public space in the two locations in class and in their journals.
